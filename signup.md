# Sign up process

### Sign up

The process of signing up on Transparent Edge’s self-service platform begins by clicking the “Sign up” button in the top right corner of the [home page](https://www.transparentedge.eu/en/). You will be redirected to a form where you have to complete two steps to create [your account](https://signup.transparentedge.eu/#/).

### Select your solution package

First, you have to choose the solution that best meets your needs from the following options:

**Advanced**

**Business**

You can find more detailed information about each package (response time, type of support provided, cost, etc.) [here](https://www.transparentedge.eu/en/prices/). If your needs ever change in the future, you can request to change your support package by sending an email to [soporte@transparentedge.eu](mailto:soporte@transparentedge.eu).

### Contact and billing information

In this second step, you can enter a promotional code or voucher in the space provided in the **contracted services** summary. You then have to fill in the following **contact information**:

#### **Full name**

#### **Email address**

This email address will be Transparent Edge’s main means of contacting you. So it’s essential that the email address you give us is valid, that you have access to it, and—very important—that you check it often. Plus, this email address will be your username when you log into the platform.

#### Web page

After your full name and email address, you have to enter the primary domain of your website, e.g.: “[www.prueba.com](http://www.prueba.com/)”.

Once you have completed the registration process and you log in to Transparent Edge’s self-service dashboard, you will see that the domain (site) you entered has been added to the settings of your brand-new profile. Of course, you are free to add as many new domains as you need or delete any that are no longer necessary.

#### Password

To continue with the registration process, you have to enter a password with at least eight characters that contains one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.

After filling in your contact information, fill in the fields with **your billing information:**

#### Company name

#### Tax ID

Your company’s tax ID code (CIF in Spain) or your personal tax ID number (NIF in Spain).

#### Address

You have to fill in all the fields to be able to continue with the registration process.

Once you've entered all the required information into the form, you’ll have to click the checkbox to accept the terms and conditions of use for the platform. You’ll also have to click the checkbox for the terms and conditions of the contract.

#### Payment authorization

Finally, you’ll have to confirm the payment authorization. To do so, you’ll be redirected through Transparent Edge’s gateway and you’ll have to enter your credit card data.

You will be charged at the end of each month based on the support package you purchased as well as your consumption.

If your payment method is rejected by the gateway, you’ll see an error message and be redirected to the registration form where you can verify the information you entered previously and fix any errors.

### User account activation

Once you have completed the registration process, you’ll have to activate your brand-new account. To do so, click on the “VERIFY YOUR EMAIL” link in the welcome message you receive in your inbox.

This welcome message is automatically sent to the email address you entered in the registration form once you have completed that step. You’ll then have 48 hours to confirm your email. You won’t have access to Transparent Edge’s self-service platform until your account is activated.

That email will also tell you Transparent Edge’s CNAME (Canonical NAME) so you can note it and adjust the DNS.

For instance, our assigned CNAME record would be: caching.cNNN.edge2befaster.net.

In addition to the CNAME, it's important for there to be a «tcdn.txt» file in the root directory of your website with the content of the activation email.

If you don’t receive an email, first check your spam folder. If it's not there either, contact Transparent Edge by sending an email to [altas@transparentedge.eu](mailto:altas@transparentedge.eu) so we can manually activate your user account.
