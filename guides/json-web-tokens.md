# JSON Web Tokens

For the use of JWT, we provide the interface of the corresponding module of Varnish Enterprise, whose complete documentation can be found at [https://docs.varnish-software.com/varnish-cache-plus/vmods/jwt/](https://docs.varnish-software.com/varnish-cache-plus/vmods/jwt/)&#x20;

The module is imported and the object is initialized by default, so it can be used through the `jwt_reader` and `jwt_writer objects.`
