# Landing in Transparent Edge

This guide is intended to help you start using Transparent Edge as quickly as possible.

First and foremost: We're always standing by to help with whatever you may need. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:soporte@transparentedge.eu) if you have any questions or even if you want us to do the initial configuration for you.

## About Transparent Edge

If you’re reading this, it's quite possible that you already know us and that you even know exactly how a CDN works. However, before you begin, we encourage you to have a look through our documentation to familiarize yourself with all the possibilities offered by Transparent Edge. [This](https://docs.transparentedge.eu/v/english/getting-started/faq/empecemos-por-el-principio) would be a good place to start.

## Sign up

Well, we can see you’ve made the decision. Still, we’d like you to know that it's never too late to turn back. You can cancel your service—much to our regret—by sending a simple [email](mailto:unsubscribe@transparentedge.eu).

But let’s not cancel before we’ve even gotten started. To create a Transparent Edge account, just go to our [sign-up](https://signup.transparentedge.eu/#/)[ ](https://signup.transparentedge.eu/#/)page. We explain everything [here](https://docs.transparentedge.eu/v/english/signup).

## Your first configuration

We try to make things easy for you and we like simple things. That’s why we've developed a [wizard](https://docs.transparentedge.eu/getting-started/dashboard/autoprovisionamiento/configuraciones-basicas) to help you create your first Transparent Edge configuration.

Remember: We love listening to you and improving our service is our number one priority. So, if you see something you don’t like or that seems confusing, or that you think can be done better or more simply, we encourage you to write us an [email](mailto:product@transparentedge.eu).&#x20;

We’d be more than happy to help you.

## So now what?

Congratulations, your website is functioning through Transparent Edge, but that’s just the beginning. Transparent Edge is based on [Varnish Enterprise](https://www.varnish-software.com/) software, opening up a world of possibilities when it comes to configuring the CDN. In our documentation portal, you’ll find the most common use cases and we explain how to implement them in our guides and tutorials section.

If you'd like to go even further, you can consult our [VCL Reference](https://docs.transparentedge.eu/config/vcl) manual, which will give you a deep understanding of what can be done with Varnish and Transparent Edge.
