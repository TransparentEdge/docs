# Safe routes

**Safe Routes** are a tool designed to make the daily work of teams easier when they need frequent access to certain areas of a website or application that are protected by advanced security measures, such as a **WAF** or **Bot Mitigation systems**.

In the dashboard’s sidebar menu, you’ll find the **Safe Routes** section, where you can create and manage secure links.

## New Safe Route

By clicking the **“New Safe Route”** button, a modal will open where you can: assign a **name** to the link, add a brief **description** (optional), select the **associated site,** enter the URL and define the **duration of the temporary cookie**.

Once a Safe Route is created, it will appear in the section’s table, from where you can **copy the URL** and share it only with people you fully trust.

Additionally, Safe Routes can be **edited or deactivated** at any time, and they include a **usage history** that allows you to check which IP addresses accessed the site and at what time through each Safe Route.
