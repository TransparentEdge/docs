# Global Whitelists

Our CDN incorporates a set of global whitelists that include IP ranges and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from trusted sources such as Googlebot, Bingbot, and other reputable crawlers and monitoring systems. The whitelists ensure that these verified sources are exempt from internal security mechanisms.

Those lists are updated daily.

**Exempted Systems:**

* UAM (Under Attack Mode)
* Bot Mitigation
* Anti-DDoS system
