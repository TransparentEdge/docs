# Dashboard

The Transparent Edge Dashboard is the tool that allows users to control what's happening to their traffic in real-time and to know the consumptions of all the contracted services.

It can be run via API for the creation of custom dashboards integrated into the client infrastructure with all desired information, and is available in both Spanish and English.

On the main page, users can instantly view all the historical information about the service provided by Transparent Edge.&#x20;

In the left-hand menu, users have direct access to the different sections that their permissions allow, such as user management, billing or the different services that Transparent provides for the client. \
