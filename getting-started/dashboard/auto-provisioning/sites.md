### Adding a new site

Adding a new site requires a verification of ownership of the domain being added, which is a security measure. If you have any doubts or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact our support [help+cdn@transparentedge.eu](mailto:help+cdn@transparentedge.eu).

The entire verification process is explained in detail when you click on "ADD SITE".

### What is the lock icon next to my sites?

This is our legacy method to obtain certificates, please refer to [this section of the documentation](ssl.md).

### I can't verify my site / I have to add a lot of sites at once

If you have any problems adding new sites, please contact our support. We can add sites in bulk and/or bypass the verification if there are any issues: [help+cdn@transparentedge.eu](mailto:help+cdn@transparentedge.eu).
