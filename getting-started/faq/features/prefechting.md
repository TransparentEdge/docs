# Prefechting

Prefetching is a functionality that lets us fetch content before it reaches users. It can be very useful on occasion. Let’s look at two examples:

* Your website sees low traffic, but when a user arrives and requests an object, you still want it to be served by the CDN's cache.
* You’re going to launch your new website and you’re expecting a great influx of visitors, which translates into a high number of requests to the CDN. If the CDN is cold and doesn’t have any objects cached, when you go live a flood of requests to your origin servers could cause systems to collapse.
