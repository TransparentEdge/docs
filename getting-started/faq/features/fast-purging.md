# Fast purging

At Transparent Edge, by default, we use fast purging to instantaneously purge content. This system lets us invalidate content on all Transparent Edge nodes in under two seconds.

#### How do we implement fast purging?&#x20;

Itâ€™s quite simple. All Transparent Edge nodes are subscribed to a fanout queue in an internal Rabbit MQ cluster. When it receives a content invalidation message from our[ API](https://docs.transparentedge.eu/v/english/getting-started/faq/glosario/api), the message is immediately consumed by an agent which runs on all our CDN nodes. The agent locally invalidates the requested content at that node.
