# Cache effectiveness

The hit ratio is one of Transparent Edge’s most important indicators. It tells us how effectively Transparent Edge is performing and the degree of optimization of a particular website.

You can see the hit ratio on Transparent Edge’s client [portal](https://dashboard.transparentcdn.com/auth/login?redirect=%2F).

A hit ratio under 80% needs to be reviewed. However, 80% means that of all the requests and bandwidth of a particular site, 80% are being served from Transparent Edge without going to the client’s origin server. So, only 20% of the requests are going to the web server.

In other words, we are saving 80% on infrastructure costs at the origin.
