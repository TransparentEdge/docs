# NoSQL (not only SQL)

A NoSQL is a database that does not use the SQL language to query and define data. The definition often encompasses various non-relational databases that lack tables and tabular relationships, where information is structured so as to give the system good horizontal scalability (adding more servers). The most common examples are for document storage or key-value systems.
