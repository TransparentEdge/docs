# Origin

When we talk about the origin, we're referring to the web servers that host your website. These servers can be in a single data center or in several. They can be in the cloud or on-premise. The only thing Transparent Edge needs for an origin to be valid is for it to respond via the HTTP protocol (with or without SSL) and via the port of your choosing (usually 80 or 443).
