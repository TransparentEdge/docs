# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that sits between the client and the server on a network infrastructure. It manages incoming requests, interacting with the server on behalf of the client. This provides an additional layer of abstraction because the client never learns of the characteristics or existence of the server or servers, instead communicating directly with the reverse proxy.

A reverse proxy is often used for safety, load balancing, caching, optimizing load times, etc.
