# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is a cloud computing model in which all the services of an infrastructure are provided through the Internet. This lets you manage all the applications, data, and operating systems while your provider manages the virtualization, the network, the storage, and the servers.

IaaS means you don’t have to maintain your own data center, with everything that involves, or worry about updating and physically checking all the equipment—the provider takes care of all that.

Normally, the user manages the infrastructure through a web panel or an API, making it easy to scale, update, and add new resources whenever necessary.
