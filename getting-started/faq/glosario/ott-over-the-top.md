# OTT (Over The Top)

An OTT or over-the-top is a media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet, bypassing the cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms that traditionally control and distribute content.

The term mainly applies to subscription-based video-on-demand services that offer film and television content.
