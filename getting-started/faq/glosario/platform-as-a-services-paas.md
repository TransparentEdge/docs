# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS or Platform as a Service is a delivery method in cloud computing that is halfway between Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).&#x20;

While IaaS provides infrastructure only, PaaS goes a step further and provides a bundle of software tools to design, test, review, and launch the product.&#x20;

PaaS providers host hardware and software on their own infrastructure. Transparent Edge fits into this framework.
