# Edge Server

In the context of the CDN, an edge server is a server whose main purpose is to serve content as close as possible to the person requesting it, reducing latency, load times, and bandwidth consumed. These servers are typically located at the logical extreme of a network, providing an entry point into the network or allowing communication between different networks.
