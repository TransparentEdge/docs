# Data Center

A data center is a facility that houses computer systems like servers, routers, switches, and firewalls, as well as other components like backup equipment and fire-suppression and air-conditioning systems. Data centers store, process, and distribute data to authorized persons and incorporate data into processes so they can be consulted and/or modified.
