# GSLB

GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) is a method of distributing Internet traffic to a network of servers in different geographical locations. GSLB ensures that requests are correctly distributed and that they take into account the location of the person using them, improving latency and preventing a single server or group of servers from carrying the entire weight of the traffic.
