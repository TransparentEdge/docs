# Internet Exchange Point

An Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is a physical infrastructure used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exchange Internet traffic between their networks. Its primary purpose is for the networks to be able to connect to each other directly through an infrastructure rather than having to do so through a third-party network. This decreases the portion of traffic, reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of the content.
