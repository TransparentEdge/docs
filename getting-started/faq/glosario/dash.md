# DASH

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)—also known as MPEG-DASH—is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high-quality streaming of multimedia content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers. MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP segments. Each segment contains a short interval of video/audio and there are multiple different segments for each bitrate.

When the content is played by a MPEG-DASH client, the client automatically selects the segment with the highest possible bitrate.
