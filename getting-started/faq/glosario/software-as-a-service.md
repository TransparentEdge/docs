# SaaS (Software as a Service)

Software as a service is a software distribution model in which the software is available through the Internet (cloud-based applications) instead of being installed locally. In this case, the service provider hosts all the infrastructure required for the application to run and the client merely makes use of the softwareâ€™s functions.
