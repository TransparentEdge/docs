# Varnish book

Transparent CDN is based on [Varnish Enterprise](https://www.varnish-software.com/), and as such, you can enjoy almost everything you can do with the Enterprise version of Varnish, but with the added advantage of it being offered as a service, reducing the cost of ownership.

Below, we provide the link to download the Varnish Book, so you can understand the power that Transparent CDN and Varnish Enterprise offer you. However, please note that being a platform as a service, we do have some [limitations](limitaciones.md).
